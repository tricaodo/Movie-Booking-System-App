# movie-booking-system
I'm using Java and JavaFX for this application. The customers can book the show that they want. They also edit their profiles (also upload their image). Beside that, the employees can edit, upload, delete and manage the movies, booked shows. This application also used sqlite database to save all data as well as easily to keep track. In order to make the application more attractive, I am using css to style the user interface.

What I have learned in this project:
  - Design pattern: singleton
  - Using sqlite database
  - Designing UI using JavaFX and CSS

Future improvement:
  - Using movie API to fetch real data from movie theater
  - Adding more functionality so that users can order food, drink,...
