# movie-booking-system
I'm using Java and JavaFX for this application. The customers can book the show that they want. They also edit their profiles (also upload their image). Beside that, the employees can edit, upload, delete and manage the movies, booked shows. This application also used mysql database to save all data as well as easily to keep track.
